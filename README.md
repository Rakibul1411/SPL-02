This project, owned by [Hasnain Sheikh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasnain-sheikh-912098257/) and [Md. Rakibul Islam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rakibul-iit-du/), aim to develop a mobile-based crowdsourcing platform for gathering real-time insights from crowdsource workers who perform various tasks across different markets. The platform will enable businesses to access actionable data collected by gig workers from shops, improving decision making in areas like marketing, product development, and market research. By leveraging crowdsourcing, the platform will allow businesses to track trends, analyze on the ground feedback, and gain insights from diverse locations. This system not only empowers gig workers by offering flexible task opportunities but also provides businesses with a scalable and dynamic way to access market data.
